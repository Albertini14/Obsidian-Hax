A Linux alternative to enum.exe for enumerating data from Windows and Samba hosts.

Enum4linux is a tool for enumerating information from Windows and Samba systems. It attempts to offer similar functionality to enum.exe formerly available fromÂ [bindview](http://www.bindview.com/).

It is written in Perl and is basically a wrapper around the Samba tools smbclient, rpclient, net and nmblookup.
