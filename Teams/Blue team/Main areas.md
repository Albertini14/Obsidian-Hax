# SOC
Security operations center is a team of cyber security professionals that monitors the network and its systems to detect malicious cyber security events. its main areas of interest are:
* Vulnerabilities
* Policy violations
* Unauthorized activity
* Network intrusions

# DFIR
Digital forensics and incident response has three main areas

## Digital forensics
Focuses on analyzing evidence of an attack and its perpetrators and other areas such as intellectual property theft, cyber espionage and possession of unauthorized content. Thus they may have a focus on diverse areas
* File system
* System memory
* System logs
* Network logs

## Incident response
Usually refering to a data breacj or a cyber attack, this can also be applied to intrusion attempts, policy violations, defacing, etc. Incident response specifies the methodology that should be followed to handle such a case in order to reduce damage and rcover in the shortest time possible

1. Preparation: This requires a team trained and ready to handle incidents. Ideally, various measures are put in place to prevent incidents from happening in the first place.
2. Detection and Analysis: The team has the necessary resources to detect any incident; moreover, it is essential to further analyze any detected incident to learn about its severity.
3. Containment, Eradication, and Recovery: Once an incident is detected, it is crucial to stop it from affecting other systems, eliminate it, and recover the affected systems. For instance, when we notice that a system is infected with a computer virus, we would like to stop (contain) the virus from spreading to other systems, clean (eradicate) the virus, and ensure proper system recovery.
4. Post-Incident Activity: After successful recovery, a report is produced, and the learned lesson is shared to prevent similar future incidents.


## Malware analysis
Aims to learn about malicious programs using either static or dynamic analysis
* Static: works by inspecting the malicious program without running it. Usually requeires solid knowledge of assembly
* Dynamic: works by running the malware in a controlled enviornment and monitoring its activities
