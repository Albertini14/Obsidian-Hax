# Network Security Solutions
Network security solutions could be software or hardware appliances used to monitor, detect and prevent malicious activities within the network. It focuses on protecting clients and devices connected to the cooperation network.
## Network Firewall
The firewall filters the untrusted traffic before passing it into the network based on rules and policies. In addition firewalls can be used to separate networks from external traffic sources, internal traffic sources, or even specific applications. Nowadays, firewall products are built-in network routers or other security products that provide various security features. The following are some firewall types that enterprises may use
- Packet-fitlering firewalls
- Proxy firewalls
- NAT firewalls
- Web app firewalls

## SIEM
Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) is used to monitor and analyze events and track and log data in real-time. SIEM helps system administrators and blue teamers to monitor and track potential security threats and vulnerabilities before causing damage to an organization.
SIEMP solutions work as log data aggregation centers, where log files from sensors are collected and it performs functions on the gathered data to identify and detect security threats or attacks. Some of the functions that SIEM offer are:
- **Log management**: It captures and gathers data for the entire enterprise netwrok in real-time
- **Event analytics**: It applies advanced analytics to detect abnormal patterns or behaviors, available in the dashboard with charts and statistics
- **Incident Monitoring and security alerts**: It monitors the entire network, including connected users, devices, applications ,etc. and as soon as attacks are detected, it alerts administrators immediately to take appropriate action to mitigate.
- **Compliance management and reporting**: It generates real-time reports at any time.
SIEM is capable of detecting advanced an unknown threats using integrated threat intelligence and AI tech, including Insider threats, security vulnerabilities, phishing attacks, Web attacks, DDoS, data exfiltration, etc.
Some common SIEM products are
- Splunk
- LogRhythm NextGen SIEM Platform
- SolarWinds Security Event Manager
- Datadog Security Monitoring

## NIDS / NIPS
Network-Based IDS/IPS has a similar concept to the [[Host Evasion#HIDS / HIPS|Host-Based IDS/IPS]]. The network based solution will be based on sensors and agents distributed in the network devices and hosts to collect data. IDS and IPS are both detection and monitoring cybersec solutions that an enterprises uses to secure its internal systems. They both read network packets looking for abnormal behaviors and known threats pre-loaded into a previous database. The significant difference between both solutions is that the IDs requires human interaction or 3rd party software to analyze the data to take action. The IPS is a control system that accepts or rejects packets based on policies and rules.
The following are common IDS/IPS products:
- Palo Alto Networks
- Cisco's Next-Generation
- McAfee Network Security Platform (NSP)
- Trend Micro TippingPoint
- Suricata
