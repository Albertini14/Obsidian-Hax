# Persistence
There are a few ways to maintain access on a machine or network. Such as the persistence Metasploit module, allowing us to create a backdoor service in the system that will give us an instant meterpreter shell if the machine is ever shutdown or reset.
Other ways may be advanced backdoors and rootkits.

To do this we need to get a meterpreter session in the target machine. Once obtained, we `use exploit/windows/local/persistence`, this module will send a payload every 10 seconds in default, however we can set this time to anything we want. 
Now if the system is shut down we will lose our meterpreter session, but by using the persistence module we create a backdoor which we can access at any time using the `multi/handler`
