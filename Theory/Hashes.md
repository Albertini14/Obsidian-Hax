Automated hash recognition tools such as [https://pypi.org/project/hashID/](https://pypi.org/project/hashID/) exist, but they are unreliable for many formats. For hashes that have a prefix, the tools are reliable. Use a healthy combination of context and tools.  If you found the hash in a web application database, it's more likely to be md5 than NTLM. Automated hash recognition tools often get these hash types mixed up, which highlights the importance of learning yourself.

Unix style password hashes are very easy to recognise, as they have a prefix. The prefix tells you the hashing algorithm used to generate the hash. The standard format is`$format$rounds$salt$hash`.

Windows passwords are hashed using NTLM, which is a variant of md4. They're visually identical to md4 and md5 hashes, so it's very important to use context to work out the hash type.

On Linux, password hashes are stored in /etc/shadow. This file is normally only readable by root. They used to be stored in /etc/passwd, and were readable by everyone.

On Windows, password hashes are stored in the SAM. Windows tries to prevent normal users from dumping them, but tools like mimikatz exist for this. Importantly, the hashes found there are split into NT hashes and LM hashes.

Here's a quick table of the most Unix style password prefixes that you'll see.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Prefix|Algorithm|
|\$1$ |md5crypt, used in Cisco stuff and older Linux/Unix systems|
|\$2$, \$2a\$, \$2b\$, \$2x\$, \$2y\$ |Bcrypt (Popular for web applications)|
|\$6$ |sha512crypt (Default for most Linux/Unix systems)|

A great place to find more hash formats and password prefixes is the [hashcat](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes) example page.
For other hash types, you'll normally need to go by length, encoding or some research into the application that generated them. Never underestimate the power of research.


# Cracking Hashes
You can't "decrypt" password hashes. They're not encrypted. You have to crack the hashes by hashing a large number of different inputs (often rockyou, these are the possible passwords), potentially adding the salt if there is one and comparing it to the target hash. Once it matches, you know what the password was. Tools like Hashcat and John the Ripper are normally used for this.

## Why crack on GPUs?

Graphics cards have thousands of cores. Although they can’t do the same sort of work that a CPU can, they are very good at some of the maths involved in hash functions. This means you can use a graphics card to crack most hash types much more quickly. Some hashing algorithms, notably bcrypt, are designed so that hashing on a GPU is about the same speed as hashing on a CPU which helps them resist cracking.

## Cracking on VMs?

It’s worth mentioning that virtual machines normally don’t have access to the host's graphics card(s) (You can set this up, but it’s a lot of work). If you want to run hashcat, it’s best to run it on your host (Windows builds are available on the website, run it from powershell). You can get Hashcat working with OpenCL in a VM, but the speeds will likely be much worse than cracking on your host. John the ripper uses CPU by default and as such, works in a VM out of the box although you may get better speeds running it on the host OS as it will have more threads and no overhead from running in a VM.

**NEVER (I repeat, NEVER!) use --force for hashcat**. It can lead to false positives (wrong passwords being given to you) and false negatives (skips over the correct hash).

UPDATE: As of Kali 2020.2, hashcat 6.0 will run on the CPU without --force. I still recommend cracking on your host OS if you have a GPU, as it will be much much faster.

# Integrity
## Integrity Checking

Hashing can be used to check that files haven't been changed. If you put the same data in, you always get the same data out. If even a single bit changes, the hash will change a lot. This means you can use it to check that files haven't been modified or to make sure that they have downloaded correctly. You can also use hashing to find duplicate files, if two pictures have the same hash then they are the same picture.

## HMACs

HMAC is a method of using a cryptographic hashing function to verify the authenticity and integrity of data. The TryHackMe VPN uses HMAC-SHA512 for message authentication, which you can see in the terminal output. A HMAC can be used to ensure that the person who created the HMAC is who they say they are (authenticity), and that the message hasn’t been modified or corrupted (integrity). They use a secret key, and a hashing algorithm in order to produce a hash.
