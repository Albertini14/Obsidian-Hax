There are many industry-standard methodologies for pentesting, but they all follow this main stages:
## General
### Information Gathering
Gathering as much publicly accessible information about your target/organisation
### Enumeration/Scanning
Discovering applications and services running on the systems. For example, finding a web server that may be potentially vulnerable
### Exploitation
Leveraging vulnerabilities discovered on a system or application.
### Privilege Escalation
Once you have exploited a system (foothold), try to expand your access to the system, horizontally (another user of the same permission group) or vertically (a higher permission user)
### Post-exploitation
* Target other hosts (pivoting)
* Gather additional information from the host
* Covering the tracks
* Report
