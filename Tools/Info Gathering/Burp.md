# Intruder
## Sniper
Is a type of attack that will take a set of payloads and iterate throughout it by placing each payload on each position. Testing all the payloads for each position one position a time.
## Battering Ram
This attack whilst maintaining only one set of payloads like Sniper, it will place each payload at every position at the same time for each iteration
## Pitchfork
Is like having two Sniper attacks running at the same time, we can have different payload sets and each will be applied to a certain position each iteration.
