Netcat is a command line application that has different uses. It supports both TCP and UDP protocols. It can function as a client that connects to a listening port; alternatively, it can act as a server that listens on a port of our choice.

To connect to a server:
```bash
nc IP PORT
```

We can then, in another terminal, open netcat in listening mode in order to echo whatever we type on one side to the other side of the TCP tunnel

```bash
nc -n -l -v -p PORT
nc -nlvp 9001 #same
```
