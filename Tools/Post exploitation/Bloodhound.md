Bloodhound is GUI that allows us to visually map out the network. This tool along with [[Bloodhound#Sharphound|SharpHound]] which is similar to [[Powerview]] takes the user, groups, trusts, etc. of the network and collects them into .json files to be used inside of bloodhound. 

# Starting
Before starting Bloodhound, we first need to start `neo4j` in another terminal
```shell
sudo neo4j console
```
We then need to go to the site that it prompts us `http://localhost:7474/browser/` and login and change the credentials as well as the port and protocol if we wanted. Finally we can start bloodhound on the terminal and login with our neo4j credentials

# SharpHound
Firstly we run Sharphound on the target machine inside a powershell instance with the execution policy bypass
```
powershell -ep bypass
```
```powershell
. .\SharpHound.ps1
```
Then we can start to enumerate and loot the machine
```powershell
Invoke-Bloodhound -CollectionMethod All -Domain CONTROLLER.local -zipFileName loot.zip
```
Now, we transfer the file to our machine and we can start Bloodhound
Once here we can `Import Graph` inside Bloodhound, in some versions this may not work, we can instead drag and drop or use `Upload files`. 
To view the graphed network we need to open the menu and select queries/Analysis, which will give us a list of precompiled queries to choose from.
