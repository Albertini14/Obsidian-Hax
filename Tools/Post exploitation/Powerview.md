Powerview is a powershell script from powershell [[Empire]] that can be used for enumerating a domain after we have already gained a shell in the system.

# Starting
First we need to start powershell on the target, setting the execution bypass policy to allow us to run scripts
```cmd
powershell -ep bypass
```
Then we can run the Powerview script
```powershell
. .\Downloads\PowerView.ps1
```

And then we can start to enumerate stuff.
Enumerate the domain users
```powershell
Get-NetUser | select cn
```
Domain groups
```powershell
Get-NetGroup -GroupName *admin*
```
Operating System
```powershell
Get-NetComputer -fulldata | select operatingsystem
```
